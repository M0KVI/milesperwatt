A very simple offline python script to calculate miles per watt for QRP radio operation. It can be used anywhere python is, for example using Termux on your mobile while on a mountain, wihtout internet. 

The script calculates miles per watt (MPW) for QRP radio contacts using Maidenhead grid locators. 
The script works offline and uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two grid locators. It then computes the miles per watt based on the power input provided by the user.
